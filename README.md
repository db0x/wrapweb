***Wrap any web app. Make it feel native.***

Turn any *web app* into a standalone Linux *desktop application* — packaged as an AppImage, with its own window, session, and taskbar entry.

Built on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). Each app gets an isolated browser profile so WhatsApp, Teams, Google Earth and your own internal tools can all run side by side without interfering.

> **Target environment: Linux🐧**
> wrapweb is built and tested on GNOME and KDE Plasma (Wayland). Features like correct WM class, taskbar grouping, window management, and the Manager's native icon integration work well on both desktops. X11 may work but is not actively tested.

## Installation

The quickest way to get started is the install script:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/db0x/wrapweb/main/install.sh)
```

> **curl not installed?** On Ubuntu 24.04 and newer, curl is no longer pre-installed.
> Install it first: `sudo apt install curl`

The script:
- checks for **Node.js ≥ 20** — if missing, offers to install it automatically via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- checks for **npm** — if missing, offers to install it via the system package manager
- checks for optional dependencies (FUSE, python3-gi, aspell) and prints install hints if any are absent
- clones the repository to `~/.local/share/wrapweb` (or a custom path passed as the first argument)
- runs `npm install`
- creates a `wrapweb` launcher entry in the application menu

Re-running the script on an existing installation does a `git pull` and reinstalls dependencies.

### Uninstall

```bash
~/.local/share/wrapweb/install.sh --uninstall
```

The script removes the desktop entry and icon, then asks interactively whether to also delete the installation directory and the app profile data (`~/.config/wrapweb/`).

### Manual setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/db0x/wrapweb.git
cd wrapweb
npm install
npm start
```

## Features

- **Isolated sessions** — each app has its own persistent profile; cookies, storage and login state never bleed across apps
- **Native feel** — no browser chrome, correct WM class for taskbar grouping and window management
- **Context menu** — Cut / Copy / Paste + Save Image As; spelling suggestions via `aspell` (falls back to English); links show **Open with [App]** and **Open in browser** (with the system default browser icon) when a routing target is known. Some apps (Teams, Office) suppress the browser context menu to show their own; in a widget, **Ctrl+right-click** forces this menu through even there, so Move/Quit stay reachable
- **Cross-app link routing** — links to URLs handled by another installed wrapweb app open directly in that app instead of the system browser; a `routing.json` plugin file (written by `install-app`, read at runtime) maps hostnames to AppImages — no rebuild required when routing changes. The file is split into `base` claims (each app's primary URL) and `routing` claims (extra URLs apps opt into via the `routingUrls` config field, with `*` wildcards, editable in the create/edit dialog); when both match a link, the `routing` claim wins
- **Per-app plugins** — main-process modules shipped under `webapps/plugins/` that extend a single app's behaviour (e.g. routing OneDrive document opens to the Word/Excel/PowerPoint app, or driving a webmail app's compose UI for `mailto:` links). Selected per app in the create/edit dialog; a change takes effect after rebuilding the AppImage. A plugin can be **configurable** — it ships its own settings dialog (`config.html`) opened from a gear button on its chip, and its values are stored per app in `pluginConfig` (e.g. the widget plugin's window corner radius)
- **About panel** — `F12` toggles an in-app About overlay showing the current domain (with a Google Safe Browsing badge when active), the app, the build versions (wrapweb / Electron / Chromium), and the loaded plugins
- **Zoom** — `Ctrl+Scroll` zooms the page, provided per app by the configurable **zoom** plugin (step size and the min/max zoom factor are set in its config dialog); a centred on-screen panel shows the current zoom percentage while zooming and auto-hides 1s after the last change (it keeps a constant size, so it always reads at 100% regardless of the page zoom). The plugin also adds a **Zoom** submenu to the context menu (zoom in / out / reset). Add it to an app in the create/edit dialog to enable zoom for that app
- **Screen sharing** — WebRTC / PipeWire capture works out of the box
- **DevTools** — `Shift+F12` to toggle
- **Single-instance enforcement** — optionally prevent a second window from opening; the existing window is focused and raised instead
- **System-wide protocol handlers** — register any app as the system's default `mailto:` handler; clicking a mail link anywhere on the desktop opens a compose window in the configured web app (Outlook, Gmail, …) — with no external mail client required
- **Private builds** — configs matching `webapps/build.private.*.json` are gitignored

## Manager

Running `npm start` (without a profile) opens the **wrapweb Manager** — a graphical overview of all configured apps. The Manager is the primary interface for adding, configuring, building, installing, and launching apps. The UI language follows the system locale (German and English supported).

![Manager UI](assets/manager.png)

### App cards

Each app is shown as a card with its icon, name, URL, and status badges. Hovering a card reveals a toolbar:

| Button | Action | Active when |
|---|---|---|
| Info | Shows all config values and filesystem paths | always |
| Build / Rebuild | Builds (or rebuilds) the AppImage | always |
| Install / Reinstall | Creates or overwrites the `.desktop` launcher entry — no rebuild required | built |
| Delete | Removes AppImage and `.desktop` file; profile data is kept | built |

Clicking the app icon directly **launches** the app — only if it is installed. Uninstalled apps show a grayed-out icon.

Only one build can run at a time; a full-screen overlay blocks other actions while a build is in progress.

### Info dialog

The info button opens a dialog showing every configured value for that app: URL, profile, icon, window geometry, user-agent, internal domains, and Cross-Origin Isolation. If the app is built, the AppImage path and profile directory are shown with **Open in file manager** buttons.

### Delete

For **user apps** (added via the Manager or private JSON configs), the delete dialog offers an additional toggle to also remove the configuration file. Without it, the card reappears on next launch and the app can be rebuilt.

### Adding a new app

Click the **+** card at the end of the grid to open the **Create App** dialog. All configuration options are available from within the Manager:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Profile | Unique identifier — lowercase letters, digits and hyphens; checked for uniqueness live |
| Name | Optional display name (derived from profile if left empty) |
| URL | The URL loaded on startup |
| Icon | Opens a searchable icon picker showing all icons available in the system icon theme |
| Width / Height | Initial window size (optional) |
| User-Agent | Choose from presets or leave empty for the default Electron UA |
| Internal domains | Extra domains that open inside the app window (e.g. OAuth redirects) — added one by one via the list widget |
| Routing URLs | Extra URLs that other apps (and Obsidian) route to this one — added one by one via the list widget; supports `*` wildcards and is checked for overlap with other apps |
| Cross-Origin Isolation | Enables `SharedArrayBuffer` — required for multi-threaded WASM |
| Single instance | Prevent more than one window of this app from opening at the same time |

New apps are saved as `webapps/build.private.<profile>.json` and are gitignored automatically.

### Side menu

The menu (top right) offers:

- **Light / Dark mode** toggle — preference is saved across sessions
- **Visibility filter** — All Apps / Embedded Apps / User Apps
- **Hide uninstalled** — suppress apps that haven't been installed yet

## System mail handler

wrapweb can register any web mail app as the system-wide default handler for `mailto:` links. Once registered, clicking a `mailto:` link in any application — browser, PDF viewer, terminal, Teams, … — opens a compose window in the configured web app. No native mail client required.

### How it works

The app's `.desktop` file declares `MimeType=x-scheme-handler/mailto`, which makes it available as a handler. When the app is installed via the Manager, a prompt asks whether it should also become the **active default**. Confirming sets the system preference via `xdg-mime default`.

The `mailto:` URL is converted to the web app's compose URL before loading. Each provider uses its own format — this is configured via `mailtoTemplate` and an optional `mailtoParamMap` in the app config (see [Config reference](#config-reference)).

The Manager displays a **Mail handler** badge on every app capable of handling `mailto:` links. The currently active default is highlighted with a **✓**. Installing any other mail-capable app and choosing to set it as default automatically transfers the role.

### Included mail-capable apps

| Config | App | Compose URL base |
|---|---|---|
| `build.outlook.json` | Microsoft Outlook | `https://outlook.cloud.microsoft/mail/deeplink/compose` |
| `build.google-mail.json` | Google Mail | `https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1` |

`mailtoParamMap` is optional — use it when the provider expects different query parameter names than the standard `mailto:` fields (`to`, `subject`, `body`, `cc`, `bcc`).

## File handler apps

Some web apps can act as the system-wide handler for a file type — so double-clicking a file in the file manager opens it directly in the wrapped app.

### draw.io

`build.drawio.json` wraps [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) and registers itself as the handler for `.drawio`, `.drawio.svg`, and `.drawio.png` files.

After installing, double-clicking any of these files in the file manager opens it directly in the app with the correct filename shown in the title bar. **Save** (`Ctrl+S`) and **Save As** work natively through the system file dialog — the file is written to disk just like in a native app.

| Format | MIME type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.drawio` | `application/x-drawio` | Native XML diagram format |
| `.drawio.svg` | `application/x-drawio-svg` | SVG export with embedded diagram XML |
| `.drawio.png` | `application/x-drawio-png` | PNG export with embedded diagram XML |

## rclone Integration (Google Drive)

wrapweb can act as a system file handler for Office formats and route them through **Google Drive** via [rclone](https://rclone.org/). Double-clicking a `.docx`, `.xlsx`, or `.pptx` file in the file manager uploads it to your Drive and opens it directly in Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides. When you close the app window, the edited file is automatically synced back to its original local path.

### Prerequisites

- **rclone** installed — see [rclone.org/install](https://rclone.org/install/)
- A **Google Drive remote** configured in rclone — see [rclone Google Drive docs](https://rclone.org/drive/) for the one-time setup

### Setup in wrapweb

1. Build and install the relevant app(s) — **Google Docs**, **Google Spreadsheets**, and/or **Google Presentation** — via the Manager
2. Open the Manager side menu → **rclone Integration**
3. Select your Google Drive remote from the dropdown
4. Set the target folder in Drive for each app (default: the app profile name, e.g. `google-docs`)
5. Click **Save**

### Workflow

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| Double-click `.docx` / `.xlsx` / `.pptx` in the file manager | wrapweb checks whether a file with that name already exists on Drive |
| File already on Drive, identical to local | Opens directly — no upload needed |
| File already on Drive, different content | Shows a comparison dialog (size, last modified) — choose to overwrite or open the Drive version |
| New file | Uploads to the configured Drive folder |
| Editing in the browser | File is open in Google Docs / Sheets / Slides |
| Close the app window | wrapweb syncs the Drive version back to the original local path |

> Uploaded files land in the configured Drive folder (e.g. `google-docs/` in your Drive root). The folder is created automatically on first use.

## Google Safe Browsing

wrapweb can check every external link you hover over against the **Google Safe Browsing** database. A small shield icon appears in the link tooltip — green for known-safe, red for a known threat.

### Privacy

Only the **origin** of the URL (`https://example.com`) is ever sent anywhere. Even then, the actual URL is never transmitted in plain text:

1. The origin is hashed with SHA-256
2. Only the first 4 bytes of the hash are sent to Google (`fullHashes:find` API)
3. Google returns all full hashes that match that prefix
4. The comparison happens locally — Google never learns the actual URL or which sites you hover over

Results are cached per origin (5 minutes for safe, 30 minutes for flagged) to keep API calls to a minimum.

### Setup

1. Create an API key in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) — Project → APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → API key. Enable the **Safe Browsing API** for the project.
2. Open the Manager side menu → **Google Safe Browsing**
3. Enable the toggle, paste your API key, click **Save**

No AppImage rebuild is required — the key and enabled state are read at runtime from `~/.config/wrapweb/safe-browsing.json`.

## Obsidian Plugin

wrapweb ships a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Once installed, external links in your notes that match a wrapweb-routed app open directly in that app instead of the system browser. All external links show a **link tooltip** at the bottom of the screen — identical in style to the tooltips in wrapweb app windows: the app icon and URL for wrapweb targets, the browser icon and URL for everything else.

### Prerequisites

- Obsidian ≥ 1.12.7 installed with at least one vault
- At least one wrapweb app built and installed (so `routing.json` exists)

### Setup

1. Open the Manager side menu → **Obsidian Integration**
2. The dialog lists all known vaults with their current plugin status
3. Click **Plugin installieren** — the plugin files are copied into every vault's `.obsidian/plugins/wrapweb/` directory
4. In Obsidian: **Settings → Community Plugins → wrapweb** → enable

When wrapweb is updated and ships a newer plugin version, the dialog shows **Update verfügbar** per vault and an **Plugin aktualisieren** button.

### Obsidian via Flatpak

If Obsidian is installed as a Flatpak, the dialog shows an extra section with the one-time command required to grant the sandbox access to your home directory — otherwise it cannot spawn the wrapweb AppImages. The command is offered with a one-click copy button:

```
flatpak override --user --filesystem=home md.obsidian.Obsidian
```

Run it once in a terminal and restart Obsidian. The hint is only displayed when a Flatpak Obsidian install is detected.

### How it works

The plugin reads `~/.config/wrapweb/plugins/routing/routing.json` at runtime — the same file that is written automatically whenever you install a wrapweb app. No rebuild and no Obsidian restart are required when routing changes.

The plugin works in both **Reading Mode** and **Live Preview** (CodeMirror 6). Routing and icon data are cached in memory; the routing file is re-read at most once per second to pick up changes without measurable overhead.

## Requirements

- **git** — required by `install.sh` to clone and update the repository
- **Node.js ≥ 20**
- **Linux** (Wayland recommended — see note above)
- **libfuse2** — required to run AppImages. FUSE 3 alone is not sufficient; AppImages need `libfuse.so.2`.
  - Ubuntu 24.04+: `sudo apt install libfuse2t64`
  - Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian: `sudo apt install libfuse2`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install fuse-libs`
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S fuse2`
- **python3-gi** — GTK bindings used by the Manager to resolve and enumerate system icon theme icons (`sudo apt install python3-gi`)
- **gtk-update-icon-cache** and **update-desktop-database** — called after installing an app; usually already present via `libgtk-3-bin` and `desktop-file-utils`
- **aspell** — spell-check suggestions in text fields (optional; `sudo apt install aspell-de` for German, etc.)

## Libraries

| Library | Used for |
|---|---|
| [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) | App shell, renderer, IPC |
| [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) | AppImage packaging |
| [OverlayScrollbars](https://github.com/KingSora/OverlayScrollbars) | Native-style overlay scrollbars in the Manager |
| [Coloris](https://github.com/mdbassit/Coloris) | Colour picker (with alpha) for plugin settings, e.g. the widget tint — via the [@melloware/coloris](https://github.com/melloware/coloris-npm) npm build |
| [Papirus Icon Theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) | Some icons in the Manager. |

## Building AppImages via CLI

The Manager handles build and install for most cases. For scripted or headless workflows, the CLI scripts remain available:

```bash
npm run build                        # build all configs
npm run build -- whatsapp            # build a single app
npm run build -- private.myapp

npm run install-app -- whatsapp      # (re-)install launcher entry without rebuilding
npm run install-app                  # all configs
```

Output lands in `dist/` as a self-contained AppImage.

## Manual config (advanced)

Apps can also be configured by placing a JSON file in the project root. This is useful for bulk setup, version-controlled shared configs, or options not yet exposed in the Manager UI.

App configs live in the `webapps/` directory. For apps you don't want to commit, use `webapps/build.private.<name>.json` — it is gitignored automatically.

### Config reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `profile` | string | **Required.** Unique identifier — used for the session, userData path, and app IDs |
| `url` | string | **Required.** URL to load on startup |
| `name` | string | Human-readable display name (default: derived from `profile`) |
| `icon` | string | Icon name resolved from the system icon theme |
| `userAgent` | string | Override the user-agent string |
| `geometry.width/height` | number | Initial window size (default: 1280 × 1024) |
| `geometry.x/y` | number | Initial window position — _deprecated, X11 only_ |
| `internalDomains` | string \| array | Extra domains allowed to open inside the app window (e.g. OAuth providers) |
| `routingUrls` | array | Extra URLs that route to this app from other apps and Obsidian, in addition to the primary `url`. Each entry is `host[/path]` and may use `*` as a greedy wildcard (matches any characters, including `/`), e.g. `"*.example.com"` or `"docs.example.com/d/*"`. Matching runs against the path **and query string**, and a pattern may carry **negative clauses** — see [Advanced routing patterns](#advanced-routing-patterns) below. A routing URL may overlap another app's **base** URL (the routing URL then wins at resolution time), but the Manager blocks entries that overlap another app's **routing** URL. Base URLs must not overlap each other |
| `crossOriginIsolation` | boolean | Enable `SharedArrayBuffer` — required for multi-threaded WASM (Google Earth) |
| `singleInstance` | boolean | Allow only one running instance; a second launch focuses the existing window instead |
| `mimeTypes` | array | Protocol schemes or MIME types this app can handle (e.g. `["x-scheme-handler/mailto"]` or `["application/x-drawio"]`) |
| `mimeExtensions` | object | Maps MIME types to file extensions for system registration (e.g. `{ "application/x-drawio": ["drawio"] }`) — triggers `update-mime-database` on install |
| `mimeIcons` | object | Maps MIME types to SVG asset filenames (from `assets/`) installed as system file-type icons (e.g. `{ "application/x-drawio": "application-vnd.x-drawio.svg" }`) |
| `fileHandler` | boolean | Enable local file handling — files passed via the system (e.g. double-click in the file manager) are read and passed to the app; also grants the `fileSystem` permission required for the File System Access API |
| `acceptsFileArg` | boolean | Allow a bare local file path as a launch argument (in addition to URLs). Needed by file-opening plugins such as `rclone-sync`; the built-in `fileHandler` implies it |
| `rcloneEditUrlBase` | string | Editor URL base used by the `rclone-sync` plugin, e.g. `"https://docs.google.com/document/d"` — the opened file's editor URL is `<base>/<id>/edit`. rclone file handling is a plugin (`plugins/rclone-sync/rclone-sync.js`); a file is uploaded to the configured Google Drive remote (Manager's rclone Integration dialog) and synced back on close |
| `mailtoTemplate` | string | Base URL for the compose window — `mailto:` parameters are appended as a query string |
| `mailtoParamMap` | object | Rename `mailto:` parameters before appending (e.g. `{ "subject": "su" }` for Gmail) |
| `plugins` | array | Main-process plugins shipped under `webapps/plugins/` that this app loads, each as a webapps-relative path (e.g. `"plugins/onedrive/onedrive.js"`). Selectable in the create/edit dialog. A plugin module exports `attachPlugin(win, api)` and extends the app's behaviour — e.g. routing OneDrive document opens to Word/Excel/PowerPoint, or driving a webmail app's compose UI on a `mailto:` launch. Changing the selection requires rebuilding the AppImage |
| `pluginConfig` | object | Per-plugin settings for this app, keyed by the plugin's webapps-relative path (e.g. `{ "plugins/widget/widget.js": { "radius": 20 } }`). A plugin that exports `configurable: true` and ships a `config.html` next to its entry file gets a gear button on its chip in the create/edit dialog; the values are passed to the plugin at runtime as `api.config`. The widget plugin uses it for the window corner radius (`radius`, 0–24, default 14), a drop shadow (`shadow`, default true; `shadowWidth` 2–8, default 8), whether the window is resizable (`resizable`, default true), whether the app's scrollbars are hidden (`hideScrollbars`, default true — wheel/touchpad scrolling stays), whether the app's own title bar / drag-zone is suppressed (`suppressAppTitlebar`, default false — neutralises any `-webkit-app-region: drag` region the app declares, so a top strip like Teams' can't move/maximise the window, and tries to stop the app drawing the strip at all by masking the standalone/window-controls-overlay signals; use the context-menu Move instead), and the background transparency: `tintBackground` (default false) is the master switch — off leaves the page untouched, on lets the desktop show through by clearing the app's root backgrounds and applying `tint` (a `#RRGGBB`/`#RRGGBBAA` hex colour, default `#000000a6` — black at ~0.65 alpha; the alpha is capped just below fully opaque so the rounded corners survive). It defaults off because it only works on pages whose own background is transparent (e.g. Home Assistant) and can strip backgrounds some apps need (e.g. draw.io's menus). The widget renders the app in an inset child view so the host window can draw the shadow + rounded corners while the page scrolls natively. The zoom plugin uses it for the `Ctrl+Scroll` zoom step (`step`, 0.05–0.5, default 0.1) and the zoom bounds (`min`, 0.3–1.0, default 0.5; `max`, 1.5–5.0, default 3.0). Changing a value requires rebuilding the AppImage |

### Advanced routing patterns

> ⚠️ **Uncommon mechanics — only reach for these when a plain `host/path*` pattern genuinely cannot tell two apps apart.** They add real complexity to `routingUrls`; most apps never need them. They exist for one specific case: Microsoft 365 documents on SharePoint.

A routing pattern is matched against the **path *and* query string** of the target URL, and may contain **negative clauses**. Two non-obvious rules:

**1. The query string is part of the match.** Unlike most routers, the matcher tests `pathname + "?" + search`, not just the path. This is necessary because SharePoint opens every Office document through the *same* generic endpoint and only the query distinguishes them:

```
https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/X/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=…&file=Report.docx
                               └──────────── path (identical for all apps) ──┘ └─ only the query differs ─┘
```

So Word claims `"https://*.sharepoint.com/*.docx*"`, Excel `"*.xlsx*"`, PowerPoint `"*.pptx*"` — the `.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx` lives in the query. (Share-style links instead carry a scheme token in the path — `:w:` Word, `:x:` Excel, `:p:` PowerPoint, `:o:` OneNote — which each app also claims, e.g. `"https://*.sharepoint.com/:w:/*"`.)

**2. A `!` adds negative clauses: `positive!not-this!not-that`.** The pattern matches only if the positive part matches **and none** of the `!`-separated path/query globs match. A glob can say "contains X" but not "does *not* contain X", so this fills that gap.

The one place this is actually used is **OneNote**: a OneNote notebook opens through the same `Doc.aspx` as Word, but its link carries **no file extension** (a notebook is a folder, so `file=` is just its name). There is no positive token to match on, so OneNote claims "a `Doc.aspx` link that is *not* one of the other three Office types":

```json
"routingUrls": [
    "https://*.sharepoint.com/:o:/*",
    "https://*.sharepoint.com/*Doc.aspx*!*.docx*!*.xlsx*!*.pptx*"
]
```

The second pattern reads: *match a `Doc.aspx` URL, but not if it contains `.docx`, `.xlsx` or `.pptx`.* Because `findRoute` tries the longest key first, a `Report.docx` URL hits this OneNote key first, its negation rejects it, and resolution falls through to Word's `*.docx*` — so OneNote never steals a Word/Excel/PowerPoint document.

The same matcher (`src/routing-match.js`) is shared by the app windows, the Obsidian plugin, and the build-time table generator, so these rules behave identically everywhere.

### Examples

```json
{ "profile": "google-docs", "url": "https://docs.google.com" }
```

```json
{
    "profile": "claude",
    "name": "Claude",
    "icon": "claude",
    "url": "https://claude.ai",
    "internalDomains": ["accounts.google.com", "github.com"]
}
```

```json
{
    "profile": "google-earth",
    "url": "https://earth.google.com",
    "crossOriginIsolation": true,
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/142.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
}
```

## Session data

Each app stores cookies, localStorage and cache under:

```
~/.config/wrapweb/<profile>/
```

Profiles are fully isolated and persist across restarts.
