// OneDrive plugin (main-process module). Hardcoded into the OneDrive AppImage for now;
// a generic per-app plugin mechanism will replace the hardcoded wiring later.
//
// Why a main-process module and not a page-injected script like the strato mail plugin:
// OneDrive opens an Office document by calling window.open() from a *cross-origin* iframe.
// A script injected into the page only lives in the top frame and can never see — let alone
// hook — that iframe's call. The new-window event, however, always surfaces in the main
// process, so this is the only place that can reliably observe and steer it.
//
// What it does: OneDrive's window.open() is called with a launcher URL, not the document URL,
// so the central setWindowOpenHandler can't route it — the real Office editor URL
// (…sharepoint.com/:w:/…) only appears a moment later when the freshly opened child window
// navigates (an in-page SPA navigation we can observe but not prevent). So we watch that
// child and, as soon as it heads to a URL another built wrapweb app claims (Word/Excel/
// PowerPoint via routing.json), we launch that app and discard the child.
//
// To avoid a stray OneDrive window flashing up, same-origin popups are created hidden; the
// child is only ever shown if it turns out NOT to be a routed document.

const TAG = '[ms-office-plugin]'

// Grace period before revealing a hidden child that never routed. The routed-document case
// resolves within a few hundred ms (open launcher → in-page nav to the doc → route + close);
// anything still unrouted after this is a genuine OneDrive popup, so we show it.

// Installs OneDrive's window-open routing on `win` (the BrowserWindow from createWindow()).
// Receives the standard plugin api from window.js loadPlugins(); it uses:
//   appOrigin, internalDomains — classify a popup as same-origin/internal (a doc launcher)
//   routeUrl(url)              — launch the claiming AppImage, returns true on a routing hit
//   claimsUrl(url)             — whether THIS app owns the doc (e.g. a OneNote note from OneNote)

      //      can also match — without self-first such a note is wrongly handed to that app.
      //   2. Another built app claims it (OneDrive → a .docx → Word): route there.
